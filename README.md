# Project Ripple <img align="right" width="150" height="150" src="https://github.com/Tejune/Project-Ripple/blob/master/images/arrow.png?raw=true">

Project Ripple is a (somewhat) lightweight 4-key rhythm player that runs using Quaver maps.<br>
Created just for fun, don't expect many updates or anything of the sort.

## Dependencies
- Quaver installed (downloaded songs in the quaver folder are used by the player)
- Python 3.11

Have fun, or not, I don't care.
